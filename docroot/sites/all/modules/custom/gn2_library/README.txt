ABOUT
------------

This module is used to create library assets in orgs.


Implementation
--------------------------

This module adds a new resource search index, a resource item content type, and panel that is placed by default in group pages.
Adding a resource item inside of a group will result in a Library tab appearing in the group, with views exposed filters that will
allow for sorting from the resource Solr index.
